## 💻 1. Project Development

### Original Work:
- Bring your ideas to life! All projects must be developed during the hackathon.
- Pre-existing projects or significant pre-written code? 🚫 Not allowed!

### AI Tools:
- Utilize AI tools to assist in your project, but fully pre-built solutions or ready-made projects are off-limits.

### Development:
- Get coding during the hackathon! You can build on past ideas but **no old code allowed!**

### Code Submission:
- All the code must be pushed to the repository provided by the organizers only. This is crucial for tracking your progress and ensuring a fair competition.

## 📜 2. Commitment to Open Source and Licensing

### Code Creation:
- All coding must happen during the hackathon.
- Use only publicly available APIs, SDKs, and lightweight tools (like Google Maps API).
- Heavy APIs? Only with the judges' approval! 🧐

### Assets:
- Any assets used should adhere to the Creative Commons License or similar licenses. Make sure you have the proper permissions!

### Repository Usage:
- Remember, all your project code should be stored in the designated repository provided by the organizers. This ensures all teams have an equal platform for showcasing their work!

## ⏰ 3. GitHub and Code Submission

### Commitment to GitHub:
- Push your code regularly (every **4 hours**). Missing commits? 😱 You could face disqualification!

### README:
Your GitHub repository must include a README that covers:
- Team details
- Project abstract
- Domain and tools used

### Final Submission:
- Ensure your projects are deployed and ready for demo presentations!

## 📝 4. Technical Do's and Don'ts for Uploading Code (Git & Hackathon)

### ✅ Do's:

**Git:**
- Use descriptive commit messages to explain your changes.
- Regularly pull updates from the remote repository to stay synced with your teammates.
- Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
- Utilize commands like `git status` and `git log` to keep track of changes.

**Team Collaboration:**
- Communicate effectively about code changes and strategies.
- Use pull requests for code review before merging.
- Resolve merge conflicts promptly.

**Hackathon Efficiency:**
- Set up your development environment beforehand to maximize coding time.
- Test your code frequently to catch bugs early.
- Use online resources and tutorials if you hit a snag.

### ❌ Don'ts:

**Git:**
- Don’t commit large binary files directly—use Git Large File Storage (LFS) instead.
- Don’t commit sensitive info (like API keys) to the repository.
- Avoid force-pushing changes; always communicate with your team first.
- Don’t wait until the last minute to push your code—stay proactive!

**Team Collaboration:**
- Don’t isolate yourself—share changes and collaborate!
- Avoid direct commits to the main branch without proper reviews.
- Don’t leave merge conflicts unresolved.

**Hackathon Efficiency:**
- Don’t spend too long learning a new technology—stick to what you know.
- Avoid neglecting comments and documentation in your code.
